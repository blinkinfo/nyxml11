"""Coinbase candle resolver — determines 5-min slot winner (Up/Down) from BTC-USD candle data.

Instead of polling the Gamma API for market resolution, this module fetches
the 5-minute candle from Coinbase covering the slot window and compares
close vs open:
  - close >= open  ->  winner = "Up"
  - close <  open  ->  winner = "Down"

resolve_slot() retries up to MAX_RETRIES times at RETRY_INTERVAL-second
intervals.  check_resolution() performs a single attempt with no retries.

Key implementation detail:
  The Coinbase Exchange API (`/products/BTC-USD/candles`) returns candles
  **newest-first** as arrays: [time, low, high, open, close, volume].
  We must validate that the returned candle timestamp matches the requested
  slot_start_ts exactly, because Coinbase may return extra candles or
  candles outside the requested window.
